# Project Background

This project was originally planned to be built using an Expo mobile application. However, due to technical issues that prevented it from functioning correctly in our development environment, we shifted to a simpler web-based format.
Despite this change, the web version fully demonstrates the intended functionalities—allowing users to manage notes, upload media, and experience the core features as envisioned.
